We mostly implemented our proxy with RAII in mind, such that everything is on the stack.
However, we do notice that some network-related aspects of the system may fail, such as:
- server shutdown during in-complete receive
- connect/accept failure
- invalid HTTP message
- in-accurate Content-Length

We handle these situations by using try-catch statements such that while operations may fail, we throw
 an error immediately after the failure and everything returns to their original state and there will be no
 memory leak since they are allocated on the stack. Plus, we use mutexes to make sure that the writes and reads
 from/to cache are logically atomic.

In this way, we believe we achieved a strong exception guarantee by taking no side effects from failure and leaving
 original values intact
